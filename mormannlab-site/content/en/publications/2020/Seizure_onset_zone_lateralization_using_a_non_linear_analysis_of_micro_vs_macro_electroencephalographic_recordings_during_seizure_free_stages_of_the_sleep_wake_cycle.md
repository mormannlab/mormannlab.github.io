  The application of non-linear signal analysis techniques to biomedical data is key to improve our knowledge about complex physiological and pathological processes. In particular, the use of non-linear techniques to study electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings can provide an advanced characterization of brain dynamics. In epilepsy these dynamics are altered at different spatial scales of neuronal organization. We therefore apply non-linear signal analysis to EEG recordings from epilepsy patients derived with intracranial hybrid electrodes, which are composed of classical macro contacts and micro wires. Thereby, these electrodes record EEG at two different spatial scales. Our aim is to test the degree to which the analysis of the EEG recorded at these different scales allows us to characterize the neuronal dynamics affected by epilepsy. For this purpose, we retrospectively analyzed long-term recordings performed during five nights in three patients during which no seizures took place. As a benchmark we used the accuracy with which this analysis allows determining the hemisphere that contains the seizure onset zone, which is the brain area where clinical seizures originate. We applied the surrogate-corrected non-linear predictability score (ψ), a non-linear signal analysis technique which was shown previously to be useful for the lateralization of the seizure onset zone from classical intracranial EEG macro contact recordings. Higher values of ψ were found predominantly for signals recorded from the hemisphere containing the seizure onset zone as compared to signals recorded from the opposite hemisphere. These differences were found …
