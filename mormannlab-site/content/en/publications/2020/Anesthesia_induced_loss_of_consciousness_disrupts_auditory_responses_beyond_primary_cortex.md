  Despite its ubiquitous use in medicine, and extensive knowledge of its molecular and cellular effects, how anesthesia induces loss of consciousness (LOC) and affects sensory processing remains poorly understood. Specifically, it is unclear whether anesthesia primarily disrupts thalamocortical relay or intercortical signaling. Here we recorded intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG), local field potentials (LFPs), and single-unit activity in patients during wakefulness and light anesthesia. Propofol infusion was gradually increased while auditory stimuli were presented and patients responded to a target stimulus until they became unresponsive. We found widespread iEEG responses in association cortices during wakefulness, which were attenuated and restricted to auditory regions upon LOC. Neuronal spiking and LFP responses in primary auditory cortex (PAC) persisted after LOC, while responses in higher-order …
