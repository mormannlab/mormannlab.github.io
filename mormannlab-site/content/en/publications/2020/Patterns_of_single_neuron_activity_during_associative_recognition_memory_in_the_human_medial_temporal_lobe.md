abstract: >
  Electrophysiological activity in medial temporal lobe (MTL) structures is pivotal for declarative long-term memory. Single-neuron and microcircuit findings capitalizing on human microwire recordings from the medial temporal lobe are still fragmentary. In particular, it is an open question whether identical or different groups of neurons participate in different memory functions. Here, we investigated category-specific responses in the human MTL based on single-neuron recordings in presurgical epilepsy patients performing an associative long-term memory task. Additionally, auditory beat stimuli were presented during encoding and retrieval to modulate memory performance. We describe the proportion of neurons in amygdala, entorhinal cortex, hippocampus and parahippocampal cortex belonging to different response classes. These entail neurons coding stimulus-familiarity, neurons coding successful item memory â€¦
