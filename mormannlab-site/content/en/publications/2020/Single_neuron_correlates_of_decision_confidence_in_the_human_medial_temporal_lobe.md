  The human medial temporal lobe (MTL) has been suggested to play a role in valuation. However, little is known about its role in binary decisions and metacognition. We performed two decision-making tasks while recording from neurons in the human MTL. During a break, subjects consumed their preferred food item to satiation and subsequently repeated both tasks. We identified both a persistent and a transient modulation of the neural activity. Two independent subpopulations of neurons showed a persistent correlation of their firing rates with either decision confidence or reaction times. Importantly, the changes in confidence and reaction time between experimental sets were accompanied by a correlated change in the neural activity, and this correlation lasted as long as it was relevant for the behavioral task. Previous studies have suggested a transient modulation of the neural activity in the human MTL …
