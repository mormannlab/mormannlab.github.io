  Objective

  Recently, we showed that resection of at least 27% of the temporal part of piriform cortex (PiC) strongly correlated with seizure freedom 1 year following selective amygdalohippocampectomy (tsSAHE) in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE). However, the impact of PiC resection on long-term seizure outcome following tsSAHE is currently unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of PiC resection on long-term seizure outcome in patients with mTLE treated with tsSAHE.

  Methods

  Between 2012 and 2017, 64 patients were included in the retrospective analysis. Long-term follow-up (FU) was defined as at least 2 years postoperatively. Seizure outcome was assessed according to the International League against Epilepsy (ILAE). The resected proportions of hippocampus, amygdala, and PiC were volumetrically assessed.

  Results

  The mean FU duration was 3.75 ± 1.61 …
