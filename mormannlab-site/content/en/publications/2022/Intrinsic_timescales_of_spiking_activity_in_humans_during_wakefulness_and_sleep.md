abstract: >
  Information processing in the brain requires integration of information over time. Such an integration can be achieved if signals are maintained in the network activity for the required period, as quantified by the intrinsic timescale. While short timescales are considered beneficial for fast responses to stimuli, long timescales facilitate information storage and integration. We quantified intrinsic timescales from spiking activity in the medial temporal lobe of humans. We found extended and highly diverse timescales ranging from tens to hundreds of milliseconds, though with no evidence for differences between subareas. Notably, however, timescales differed between sleep stages and were longest during slow wave sleep. This supports the hypothesis that intrinsic timescales are a central mechanism to tune networks to the requirements of different tasks and cognitive states.
