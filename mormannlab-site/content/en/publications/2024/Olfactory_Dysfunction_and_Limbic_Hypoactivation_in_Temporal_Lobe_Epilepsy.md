  The epileptogenic network in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) contains structures of the primary and secondary olfactory cortex such as the piriform and entorhinal cortex, the amygdala, and the hippocampus. Olfactory auras and olfactory dysfunction are relevant symptoms of TLE. This study aims to characterize olfactory function in TLE using olfactory testing and olfactory functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We prospectively enrolled 20 individuals with unilateral TLE (age 45 ± 20 years [mean ± SD], 65% female, 90% right-handed) and 20 healthy individuals (age 33 ± 15 years [mean ± SD], 35% female, 90% right-handed). In the TLE group, the presumed seizure onset zone was left-sided in 75%; in 45% of the individuals with TLE limbic encephalitis was the presumed etiology; and 15% of the individuals with TLE reported olfactory auras. Olfactory function was assessed with a Screening Sniffin...
