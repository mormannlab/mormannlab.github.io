  The number zero holds a special status among numbers, indispensable for developing a comprehensive number theory. Despite its importance in mathematics, the neuronal foundation of zero in the human brain is unknown. We conducted single-neuron recordings in neurosurgical patients while they made judgments involving nonsymbolic number representations (dot numerosity), including the empty set, and symbolic numbers (Arabic numerals), including numeral zero. Neurons showed responsiveness to either the empty set or numeral zero, but not both. Neuronal activity to zero in both nonsymbolic and symbolic formats exhibited a numerical distance effect, indicating that zero representations are integrated together with countable numerosities and positive integers at the low end of the number line. A boundary in neuronal coding existed between the nonsymbolic empty set and small...
