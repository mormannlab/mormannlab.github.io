abstract: >
  Confusion, aphasia, and unaware wandering are prominent post-ictal symptoms regularly observed in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Despite the potentially life-threatening nature of the immediate post-ictal state, its neurobiological underpinnings remain understudied. We provide evidence in mice and humans that seizure-associated focal spreading depolarization (sSD) is a pathological key factor in epilepsy. Using two-photon or widefield imaging (hippocampus, neocortex), field potential and single unit recordings, and behavioral assessment in mice, we first studied seizures during viral encephalitis, and subsequently established an optogenetic approach to dissociate hippocampal seizures and SD. We find region-specific occurrence of sSD that displays distinct spatial trajectories to preceding seizures, and show that seizure-related and isolated hippocampal SD prompt post-ictal wandering. This clinically relevant locomotor phenotype occurred in the absence of hippocampal SD progression to the neocortex. Finally, we confirm sSD existence in human epilepsy, in a patient cohort with refractory focal epilepsy, via Behnke-Fried electrode recordings. In this cohort, sSD displayed a similar temporomesial propensity as in mice. This work uncovers sSD as a previously underrecognized pathological entity underlying postictal behavioral abnormalities in epilepsy. Our results carry wide-reaching ramifications for epilepsy research and neurology, and challenge current EEG-standards.
