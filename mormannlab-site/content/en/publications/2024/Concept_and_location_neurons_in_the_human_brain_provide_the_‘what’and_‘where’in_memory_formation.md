  Our brains create new memories by capturing the ‘who/what’, ‘where’ and ‘when’ of everyday experiences. On a neuronal level, mechanisms facilitating a successful transfer into episodic memory are still unclear. We investigated this by measuring single neuron activity in the human medial temporal lobe during encoding of item-location associations. While previous research has found predictive effects in population activity in human MTL structures, we could attribute such effects to two specialized sub-groups of neurons: concept cells in the hippocampus, amygdala and entorhinal cortex (EC), and a second group of parahippocampal location-selective neurons. In both item- and location-selective populations, firing rates were significantly higher during successfully encoded trials. These findings are in line with theories of hippocampal indexing, since selective index neurons may act as pointers to neocortical …
