  A central function of the human brain is to adapt to new situations based on past experience. Adaptation is reflected behaviorally by shorter reaction times to repeating or similar stimuli, and neurophysiologically by reduced neural activity in bulk-tissue measurements with fMRI or EEG. Several potential single-neuron mechanisms have been hypothesized to cause this reduction of activity at the macroscopic level. We here explore these mechanisms using an adaptation paradigm with visual stimuli bearing abstract semantic similarity. We recorded intracranial EEG (iEEG) simultaneously with spiking activity of single neurons in the medial temporal lobes of 25 neurosurgical patients. Recording from 4917 single neurons, we demonstrate that reduced event-related potentials in the macroscopic iEEG signal are associated with a sharpening of single-neuron tuning curves in the amygdala, but with an overall reduction of â€¦
