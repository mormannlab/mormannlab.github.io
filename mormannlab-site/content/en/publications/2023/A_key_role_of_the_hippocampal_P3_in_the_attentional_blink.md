  The attentional blink (AB) refers to an impaired identification of target stimuli (T2), which are presented shortly after a prior target (T1) within a rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) stream. It has been suggested that the AB is related to a failed transfer of T2 into working memory and that hippocampus (HC) and entorhinal cortex (EC) are regions crucial for this transfer. Since the event-related P3 component has been linked to inhibitory processes, we hypothesized that the hippocampal P3 elicited by T1 may impact on T2 processing within HC and EC. To test this hypothesis, we reanalyzed microwire data from 21 patients, who performed an RSVP task, during intracranial recordings for epilepsy surgery assessment (Reber et al., 2017). We identified T1-related hippocampal P3 components in the local field potentials (LFPs) and determined the temporal onset of T2 processing in HC/EC based on single-unit response â€¦
