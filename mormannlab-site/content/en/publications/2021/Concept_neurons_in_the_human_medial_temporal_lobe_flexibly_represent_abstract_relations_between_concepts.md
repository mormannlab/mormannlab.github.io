abstract: >
  Concept neurons in the medial temporal lobe respond to semantic features of presented stimuli. Analyzing 61 concept neurons recorded from twelve patients who underwent surgery to treat epilepsy, we show that firing patterns of concept neurons encode relations between concepts during a picture comparison task. Thirty-three of these responded to non-preferred stimuli with a delayed but well-defined onset whenever the task required a comparison to a response-eliciting concept, but not otherwise. Supporting recent theories of working memory, concept neurons increased firing whenever attention was directed towards this concept and could be reactivated after complete activity silence. Population cross-correlations of pairs of concept neurons exhibited order-dependent asymmetric peaks specifically when their response-eliciting concepts were to be compared. Our data are consistent with synaptic mechanisms …
